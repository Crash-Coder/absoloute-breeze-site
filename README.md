READ ME - Absolute Breeze

The Absolute Breeze Event Center Website is a fully responsive multi-page site built to showcase the amenities and offerings of the Absolute Breeze Event Center in Clayton, NY. This project was developed as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to create clean, functional, and visually appealing websites using the raw foundations of web development.

The Stack:

HTML5 - Used to create the structure of the pages.

CSS - Layout, styles, responsive design.

JavaScript - Added interactivity where HTML and CSS alone were insufficient.


Features:

Responsive Design - Utilizes CSS media queries to adjust layout across devices

Hamburger Navigation Menu - Simplifies navigation on smaller screens

Flipcards - Highlight and showcase the various amenities offered by the event center.

Contact Form - Allows visitors to send emails directly to the event center owner.

To view the website locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Crash-Coder/absolute-breeze-site.git
Navigate into the project directory:

cd absolute-breeze-site
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.
No additional setup is required.
